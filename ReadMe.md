Project compared the efficiency of the AVL and BST algorithms to insert and search through data. See the report for more details. 

To run the program, to return the number of insert ad search operations, in the terminal: 
```
java <algorithm> <Area_DataSetLength_InputFile>
```
<algorithm> : "LSBSTApp" or "LSAVLApp"
<Area_DataSetLength_InputFile> : e.g. "4_22_04"
